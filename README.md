CloudCVBackend
==============

This is a variation on C++ backend module for CloudCV. This library exports selected image processing algorithms to Node.js. 
It does data marshalling and asynchronous processing according to Node.js paradigm. I've been primarily working on getting the object
detection functionality of OpenCV to work from within Node.js. To see the original repository with all its glory go to:
